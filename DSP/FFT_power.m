function [f,p] = FFT_power(y,fs)
% function [f,p] = FFT_power(y,fs)
% 
% Given a signal and its sampling frequency, calculates the FFT power
% spectrum associated to it.
% 
% Inputs:
% y:    The signal to analyze.
% fs:   Sampling frequency of the signal.
% 
% Outputs:
% f:    Frequency vector of the FFT power spectrum.
% p:    The FFT power spectrum itself.
