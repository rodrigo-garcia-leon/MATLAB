Auditory-Modeling Toolbox (AMT)

--------- Running the AMT --------------------

AMT depends on LTFAT.  You must first download LTFAT from
http://ltfat.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the downloaded file. 
In the AMT, there is a pre-prepared directory /thirdparty/ltfat
where the LTFAT can be stored. Alternatively, set the path to your
LTFAT installation to the search path of Matlab/Octave.

To start the AMT, type "amtstart".

The "amtstart" command will add all the necessary
subdirectories (so please don't add these manually), and will print
statements telling you which backend you are currently using.

See http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/notes/ for more details.

-------- Compiling the AMT  -------------------

Some models require compiled libraries. 
If you wish to compile the C and Fortran functions in the AMT,
execute the "amtmex" command. This will execute all the necessary
compilation scripts if you have the required compilers installed.
