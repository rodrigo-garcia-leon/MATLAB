function zresponse = gfb_filter_zresponse(filter, z)
%GFB_FILTER_ZRESPONSE  Filter response at freqenzy z
%   Usage: zresponse = gfb_filter_zresponse(filter, z)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     filter  : A gfb_Filter struct as created by gfb_filter_new.
%     z       : A vector of z-plane frequencies where the frequency response should
%               be computed. z = exp(2i*pi*f/fs)
%   Output parameters:
%     zresponse : The complex response of the filter at z.
%
%   Computes the frequency response of the gammatone filter at the frequency z.
