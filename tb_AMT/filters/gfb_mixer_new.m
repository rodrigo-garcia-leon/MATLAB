function mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
%GFB_MIXER_NEW  Create new mixer
%   Usage: mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     analyzer : A gfb_analyzer structure as created by
%                gfb_analyzer_new. The mixer created by this function can
%                act as part of a synthesizer
%                that resynthesizes the output of this analyzer
%     delay :    A gfb_Delay structure as created by gfb_delay_new, together
%                with the mixer created by this function, this delay can
%                form a synthesizer that resynthesizes the output of the
%                analyzer
%     iterations : The gain factors are approximated numerically in
%                  iterations.  If this parameter is omitted, then the
%                  number of iterations will be GFB_GAINCALC_ITERATIONS
%                  (see gfb_set_constants.m, usually =100)
%
%   GFB_MIXER_NEW creates a gfb_mixer object with gain factors suitable
%   to calculate a weighted sum of the bands present in the output of the
%   given delay.  The gain factors are computed using a numerical optimization
%   method described in Herzke & Hohmann (2007).
