function outsig = irns(d,iterations,gn,siglen,fs);
%IRNS	Generate iterated rippled noise
%   Usage: outsig=irns(delay,iterations,gn,siglen,fs)
%
%   Input parameters:
%      d          : delay in ms of the time-shifted noise adding process
%      iterations : number of iterations of the adding process
%      gn         : relative gain of irn
%      siglen	  : signal length of irn in samples
%      fs         : sampling rate in Hz
%
%   IRNS(d,iterations,gn,siglen,fs) generates a signal consisting of
%   white noise, with iterations added to itself with a delay of d (in
%   ms).
%
%   An example:
%
%     fs = 44100;
%     signal = irns(4,6,1,fs,fs);
%     sound(signal,fs)

% ------ Checking of input parameters ---------

error(nargchk(5,5,nargin));

% ------ Computation --------------------------

% Frequency to which the delay corresponds
freq = 1000/d;
% Number of samples for the noise (slightly longer to avoid circular iterations 
% (S. Uppenkamp)
noiselen = siglen + round(iterations*fs/freq);
% Number of samples for the delay
delaylen = round(fs/freq);
% Create white noise
noisesig = randn(1,noiselen);

% Iterate delay and add n times
for ii = 1:iterations
  dnoise(delaylen+1:noiselen) = noisesig(1:noiselen-delaylen);
  dnoise(1:delaylen) = noisesig(noiselen-delaylen+1:noiselen);
  noisesig = noisesig + gn*dnoise;
end

% Take first bit of result as IRN
outsig = noisesig(1:siglen);
% Scale to RMS of 1
outsig = outsig/rms(outsig);
