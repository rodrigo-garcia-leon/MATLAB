%   Input parameters:
%     MixEnv       : The envelope of a signal which have been processed
%                    in some way
%     NoiseEnv     : The noise envelope with/without processing
%     fs           : Sampling frequency
%     outSNRenvs   : 1x7 vector of overall SNRenv's in dB,
%                    one for each modulation filter center frequency
%     fcs_EPSM     : center-frequencies of the modulation filterbank
%     sEPSM_ExPtns : Envelope power excitation patterns for of the input
% 
%   [fcs_EPSM,outSNRenvs]=JOERGENSEN2011SNRENV(MixEnv,NoiseEnv,fs)
%   calculates the SNRenv for the processed signal.
